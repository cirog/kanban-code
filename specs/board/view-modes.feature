Feature: Board View Modes
  As a developer managing many Claude Code sessions
  I want to switch between kanban and list layouts
  So that I can use the presentation that fits the task at hand

  Background:
    Given the Kanban Code application is running
    And I have at least one visible card on the board

  @e2e
  Scenario: Switch from kanban to list view
    Given the board is shown in kanban view
    When I switch the board to list view
    Then I should see the same visible cards in a vertical list
    And the list should group cards by workflow status
    And each group should preserve the board column order
    And workflow sections should remain visible even when they have no cards

  @e2e
  Scenario: Collapse an empty workflow section in list view
    Given the board is shown in list view
    And the "Backlog" workflow section has no cards
    When I collapse the "Backlog" section
    Then the "Backlog" section header should remain visible
    And the empty section body should be hidden until I expand it again

  @e2e
  Scenario: Clicking the full workflow header toggles collapse
    Given the board is shown in list view
    When I click anywhere in the "In Review" workflow section header
    Then the "In Review" section should toggle between collapsed and expanded

  @integration
  Scenario: Backlog refresh control remains separate from collapse
    Given the board is shown in list view
    And the "Backlog" workflow section is expanded
    When I click the refresh control in the "Backlog" section header
    Then the backlog should refresh
    And the "Backlog" section should remain expanded

  @e2e
  Scenario: Selected card survives a view mode change
    Given I have selected a card on the board
    When I switch between kanban view and list view
    Then the same card should remain selected
    And the card detail inspector should continue showing that card

  @e2e
  Scenario: View mode persists across relaunch
    Given I switch the board to list view
    When I quit and relaunch Kanban Code
    Then the board should reopen in list view
