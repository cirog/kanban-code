Feature: Remote Execution
  As a developer with a powerful remote server
  I want Kanban to support running Claude Code remotely
  So that my local machine stays fast while heavy work runs on the server

  Background:
    Given the Kanban application is running
    And remote execution is configured

  # ── Shell Interception ──
  # (Learned from claude-remote: $SHELL override, path replacement)

  Scenario: Launching Claude with remote shell
    Given remote execution is configured for a project
    When a Claude session is started for that project
    Then the SHELL environment variable should point to the fake shell
    And the fake shell should be named "zsh" (symlink) for compatibility
    And `exec claude` should inherit the SHELL override

  Scenario: Command routing through fake shell
    Given Claude executes a command via $SHELL -c "npm test"
    Then the fake shell should:
      | Step | Action                                             |
      | 1    | Check remote availability (plain SSH, no ControlMaster) |
      | 2    | If available: flush Mutagen sync                   |
      | 3    | Replace local paths with remote paths in command   |
      | 4    | Execute via SSH with ControlMaster                 |
      | 5    | Replace remote paths with local paths in output    |
      | 6    | Handle pwd tracking (Claude's working dir file)    |
      | 7    | Flush Mutagen sync after completion                |
      | 8    | Return exit code                                   |

  Scenario: Path replacement in commands
    Given localPath is "~/Projects/remote"
    And remotePath is "/home/ubuntu/Projects"
    When Claude runs a command containing "~/Projects/remote/langwatch-saas"
    Then it should be replaced with "/home/ubuntu/Projects/langwatch-saas"
    And paths in output should be reverse-replaced

  Scenario: Working directory tracking
    Given Claude appends `&& pwd -P >| /tmp/file` to commands
    Then the fake shell should:
      | Step | Action                                          |
      | 1    | Strip the pwd capture from the command          |
      | 2    | Append a MARKER and pwd to the remote command   |
      | 3    | Split output on MARKER to get remote pwd        |
      | 4    | Translate remote pwd to local path              |
      | 5    | Write local path to Claude's expected file      |

  # ── SSH Multiplexing ──

  Scenario: SSH ControlMaster for connection reuse
    Given remote commands execute frequently
    Then SSH should use ControlMaster with:
      | Setting        | Value                                |
      | ControlMaster  | auto                                 |
      | ControlPath    | /tmp/ssh-kanban-%r@%h:%p             |
      | ControlPersist | 600 (10 minutes)                     |
    And subsequent commands should reuse the connection

  Scenario: Stale SSH socket detection
    Given the SSH control socket exists but is stale
    When a command is attempted
    Then the socket should be tested with `ssh -O check`
    And if stale, deleted and recreated
    And the command should still succeed

  # ── Local Fallback ──
  # (Learned from claude-remote: state file, cooldown, notifications)

  Scenario: Automatic local fallback when remote unavailable
    Given the remote server is unreachable
    When Claude tries to execute a command
    Then the command should execute locally instead
    And a macOS notification should fire: "Claude Remote: Running locally"
    And the UI should show "local" indicator on the session card

  Scenario: Fallback notification cooldown
    Given the remote is offline
    And a notification was sent 2 minutes ago
    Then no repeat notification should be sent
    Until the 5-minute cooldown elapses

  Scenario: Reconnection notification
    Given commands were running locally due to offline remote
    When the remote becomes available again
    Then a notification should fire: "Claude Remote: Back online"
    And subsequent commands should route to remote
    And the UI indicator should switch to "remote"

  Scenario: State persistence for online/offline
    Given the remote connection state changes
    Then the state should be persisted to a temp file
    And the last notification timestamp should be tracked
    And state transitions should be: offline → online or online → offline

  # ── Display ──

  Scenario: Remote indicator on session cards
    Given a session is running with remote execution
    Then the card should show a "remote" badge
    And hovering should show the remote host name

  Scenario: Local fallback indicator
    Given a session fell back to local execution
    Then the card should show a "local (fallback)" badge in yellow
    And a tooltip should explain the remote is unavailable

  # ── Edge Cases ──

  Scenario: Remote not configured for a project
    Given remote execution is configured only for ~/Projects/remote/*
    And I start a session for ~/Projects/local-project
    Then the session should run locally without any remote shell
    And no remote indicators should appear

  Scenario: Remote profile sourcing
    Given the remote machine needs ~/.profile for PATH
    Then remote commands should source ~/.profile first
    And .bashrc non-interactive guard should be bypassed:
      `sed 's/return;;/;;/' ~/.bashrc`
